"""
Unified Framework for Tree Invariants: Joint Generating Functions, Generalized Models, and Refined Asymptotics

Authors: Charles C. Norton & OpenAI's o3-mini-high
Date: February 5th, 2025

This script implements a unified theory for tree invariants in full binary trees, with extensions to
generalized tree models (e.g., full ternary trees). It computes several invariants:
  - Cherries: Number of internal nodes whose both children are leaves.
  - Colless Index: Sum over all internal nodes of |(number of leaves in left subtree) - (number of leaves in right subtree)|.
  - Sackin Index: Sum of depths of all leaves (root at depth 0).

The script performs the following:
1. Generates all full binary trees (and, as an example, full ternary trees) for a given number of leaves.
2. Computes the above invariants for each tree.
3. Constructs a joint generating function for full binary trees:
       F(x, y, z) = sum_{n,c,k} a_{n,c,k} x^n y^c z^k,
   where a tree with n leaves, c cherries, and Colless index k contributes x^n y^c z^k.
4. Extracts univariate generating functions (marginals) by specializing variables (e.g., setting y=z=1 recovers the Catalan GF).
5. Performs a refined asymptotic analysis of a marginal generating function (e.g., the one for cherries).
6. Provides an extension to full ternary trees as a demonstration of our frameworkâ€™s generality.

This script is designed to be rigorous and self-contained.
